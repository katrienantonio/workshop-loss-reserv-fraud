## Workshop Analytics for Loss Modelling, Reserving and Insurance Fraud, 2020

by Katrien Antonio and Jonas Crevecoeur

Course materials for the online *Loss Modelling, Reserving and Insurance Fraud* course in November 2020.

`r emo::ji("calendar")` November 25, 26 and 27, 2020
<br>
`r emo::ji("clock")` From 9.30 am to 12.30 pm
<br>
`r emo::ji("location")` online

Course materials will be posted in the days before the workshop. 

## Overview

<p text-align="justify"> This three-half-day workshop introduces the *essential concepts of building insurance loss models with R*. On the **first half-day**, you will gain insights in the foundations of handling **loss data**, including useful *data wrangling and visualization steps*. You will cover a variety of *discrete and continuous loss distributions*, and techniques to build more flexible distributions from standard distributions (by mixing and splicing). You will learn how to fit these models to actual data and inspect their goodness-of-fit. Then, you will use the fitted model to estimate risk measures. The **second half-day** then puts focus on **reserving** analytics. Starting from a granular data set with the development of individual claims, you will learn how to get useful insights from the data. Step-by-step you will move from the granular data to aggregated data in a run-off triangle. You will fit the famous chain ladder method and examine its validity on the given data. Alternative modelling strategies based on recent research will be discussed. The **third half-day** then covers challenges in building **fraud** detection models from tabular and networked data. 
You will acquire insights in the foundations of these analytic methods, learn how to set-up the model building process, and focus on building a good understanding of the resulting model output and predictions.</p> 

<p align="justify">Leaving this workshop, you should have a firm grasp of the working principles of a variety of loss models for frequency and severity data and be able to explore their use in practical settings. Moreover, you should have acquired the fundamental insights to explore some other methods on your own.</p>

## After the workshop: want to more know?

An excellent collection of tutorials, books, workshops, events is available via

[http://www.actuarialdatascience.org](http://www.actuarialdatascience.org)

## Prework

<p align="justify">The workshop requires a basic understanding of R. We prepared some prework sheets that you can take a look at before the workshop ([html](https://katrienantonio.github.io/workshop-loss-reserv-fraud-2020/sheets/prework/prework_day_0.html) or [pdf](https://katrienantonio.github.io/workshop-loss-reserv-fraud-2020/sheets/prework/prework_day_0.pdf)). Yet another good starting level is the material covered in the [1-Basic](https://github.com/katrienantonio/workshop-R/tree/master/1%20-%20Basic%20R) folder of the [Programming in R](https://github.com/katrienantonio/workshop-R) workshop taught at Nationale Nederlanden in June 2019.</p>

Being familiar with statistical or machine learning methods is *not* required. The workshop gradually builds up these concepts, with an emphasis on hands-on demonstrations and exercises.

## Software Requirements

You have two options to join the coding exercises covered during the workshop. Either you join the RStudio cloud workspace dedicated to the workshop, and then you'll run R in the cloud, from your browser. Or you use your local installation of R and RStudio.

### R Studio Cloud

If you prefer not to work with a local installation of R (and the necessary packages), you can join our workspace on R Studio Cloud. This should be a very accessible set-up for working with R in the cloud for the less experienced user!

[https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/106312/join?access_code=g0TatB6C38IBSJ587PAhr7p8eRSQgrkd4ks2Z8i4](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/106312/join?access_code=g0TatB6C38IBSJ587PAhr7p8eRSQgrkd4ks2Z8i4) 

After creating an account for RStudio you will be able to work with the scripts and data sets in the cloud. We will have everything set up for you in the correct way. You only have to login!

### Local installation

Please bring a laptop with a recent version of R and RStudio installed. Make sure you can connect your laptop to the internet (or download the course material one day before the start of the workshop). You will need:

- R (at least 3.5.2 <https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>)
- RStudio (<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>)

Please run the following script in your R session to install the required packages

```{r, eval = FALSE}
packages <- c("tidyverse", "here", "gridExtra", "caret", "rsample", "recipes", "grid", "rstudioapi", "MASS", "actuar", "statmod", "ReIns", "pscl", "zoo", "igraph", "expm", "DMwR", "pROC", "ChainLadder", "lubridate")
new_packages <- packages[!(packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new_packages)) install.packages(new_packages)

if(sum(!(packages %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"]))) {
  stop(paste('The following required packages are not installed:\n', 
             paste(packages[which(!(packages %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"]))], collapse = ', ')));
} else {
  message("Everything is set up correctly. You are ready to go.")
}
```
