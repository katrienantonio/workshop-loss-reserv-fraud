## Workshop Analytics for Loss Modelling, Reserving and Insurance Fraud

by Katrien Antonio and Jonas Crevecoeur

Course materials for the online *Loss Modelling, Reserving and Insurance Fraud Analytics* course in June 2021.

`r emo::ji("calendar")` June 3, 10 & 17 2021
<br>
`r emo::ji("clock")` From 3pm to 6pm
<br>
`r emo::ji("location")` online via MS Teams

Course materials will be posted in the days before the workshop. 

## Overview

<p text-align="justify"> This three-half-day workshop introduces the *essential concepts of building insurance loss models with R*. 

On the **first half-day**, you will gain insights in the foundations of handling **loss data**, including useful *data wrangling and visualization steps*. You will cover a variety of *discrete and continuous loss distributions*, and techniques to build more flexible distributions from standard distributions (by mixing and splicing). You will learn how to fit these models to actual data and inspect their goodness-of-fit. Then, you will use the fitted model to estimate risk measures. 

The **second half-day** then puts focus on **reserving** analytics. Starting from a granular data set with the development of individual claims, you will learn how to get useful insights from the data. Step-by-step you will move from the granular data to aggregated data in a run-off triangle. You will fit the famous chain ladder method and examine its validity on the given data. Alternative modelling strategies based on recent research will be discussed. 

The **third half-day** then covers challenges in building **fraud** detection models from tabular and networked data. 
You will acquire insights in the foundations of these analytic methods, learn how to set-up the model building process, and focus on building a good understanding of the resulting model output and predictions.</p> 

<p align="justify">Leaving this workshop, you should have a firm grasp of the working principles of a variety of loss models for frequency and severity data and be able to explore their use in practical settings. Moreover, you should have acquired the fundamental insights to explore some other methods on your own.</p>

## Prework

<p align="justify">The workshop requires a basic understanding of R. We prepared some prework sheets that you can take a look at before the workshop ([html](https://katrienantonio.github.io/workshop-loss-reserv-fraud/sheets/prework/prework_day_0.html) or [pdf](https://katrienantonio.github.io/workshop-loss-reserv-fraud/sheets/prework/prework_day_0.pdf)). 

Being familiar with statistical or machine learning methods is *not* required. The workshop gradually builds up these concepts, with an emphasis on hands-on demonstrations and exercises.

## Software Requirements

You have **two options** to join the coding exercises covered during the
workshop. Either you join the RStudio cloud workspace dedicated to the
workshop, and then you'll run R in the cloud, from your browser. Or you
use your local installation of R and RStudio.

We kindly ask participants to **join the RStudio Cloud as default**! 

### RStudio Cloud - default!

You will join our workspace on R Studio Cloud. This
enables a **very accessible set-up** for working with R in the cloud
for the less experienced user!

[https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/147546/join?access_code=YgLiHaQpPvZdcbh943QMO%2FqtF%2FKTct855m5tYtmH](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/147546/join?access_code=YgLiHaQpPvZdcbh943QMO%2FqtF%2FKTct855m5tYtmH)

Here are the steps you should take (before the workshop):

- visit the above link
- log in by creating an account for RStudio Cloud or by using your Google or GitHub login credentials
- join the space
- at the top of your screen you see ‘Projects’, click ‘Projects’
- with the ‘copy’ button (on the right) you can make your own version of the ‘day 1 on loss modelling’ project; in this copy you can work on the exercises, add comments etc.
- you should now be able to visit the project and see the ‘scripts’ and ‘data’ folders on the right. Open and run the ‘installation-instructions.R’ script from the scripts folder, to see if everything works fine.

We will have everything set up for you in the correct way. You only have to login!

### Local installation - optional (make sure you have access to the RStudio Cloud as sketched above)!

Alternatively, you can bring a laptop with a recent version of R and RStudio installed.
Make sure you can connect your laptop to the internet (or download the
course material one day before the start of the workshop). You will
need:

  - R (at least 3.5.2 <https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>)
  - RStudio
    (<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>)

In the `prework` folder you will find a step-by-step guide to installing R and RStudio (though a bit outdated). 

Please run the following script in your R session to install the
required packages

```{r, eval = FALSE}
packages <- c("tidyverse", "here", "gridExtra", "caret", "rsample", "recipes", "grid", "rstudioapi", "MASS", "actuar", "statmod", "ReIns", "pscl", "zoo", "igraph", "expm", "pROC", "ChainLadder", "lubridate")
new_packages <- packages[!(packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new_packages)) install.packages(new_packages)

if(sum(!(packages %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"]))) {
  stop(paste('The following required packages are not installed:\n', 
             paste(packages[which(!(packages %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"]))], collapse = ', ')));
} else {
  message("Everything is set up correctly. You are ready to go.")
}
```

Research-wise Katrien puts focus on pricing, reserving and fraud analytics, as well as mortality dynamics. </p>

<p align="justify">*Jonas Crevecoeur* is a post-doctoral researcher in biostatistics at KU Leuven. He recently obtained his PhD within the insurance research group at KU Leuven and holds the degrees of MSc in Mathematics, MSc in Insurance Studies and MSc in Financial and Actuarial Engineering (KU Leuven).
